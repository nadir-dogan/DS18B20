#DS18B20

DS18B20 readings 3~4Â°C higher than actual :(

I have both original Dallas and Chinese DS18B20s.
I used them on Leonardo and on ESP32-C6 unfortunately everytime results is 3~4 C higher than actual temperature.
I'm working on this issue about one week. Not found any solution yet.
If anyone have helpful knowledge I will be more happy.
My subject is not to do any calibration.
I'm looking for correct native readings.
Thanks... #DS18B20
